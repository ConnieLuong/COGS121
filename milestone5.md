### User story

Our appâ€™s target population are dads-to-be and first time fathers who may be struggling to find ways to become more involved in the process of pregnancy and raising a newborn child. Our app seeks to improve 3 aspects of this process: personal development in regards to fatherhood, his relationship with his wife, and his relationship with his baby. Since our app is essentially a collection of resources for fathers, we imagine that it would be used in such a way that when a dad has questions in regards to a particular situation that he is in involving the infant or his wife, he would open Daddy's House to gain access to reliable and comprehensive information on fatherhood. For example, if a father current methods for calming down a crying infant are unsuccessful, he could search through the tips section on our app to find a "tip article" on ways to soothe a fussy baby. Our app would then provide suggestions for the father. He would also be able to favorite the tip and it would be stored on his profile for more immediate access the next time around. Also, our app contains collections of songs and stories for when a dad might want to play music or read a story to his infant. For example, if a father is waiting outside for his wife to finish grocery shopping and the infant gets fussy, he could open up the app and find a children's story that he could read to the baby as a way to pass time and keep the baby calm. 

### UI screenshots
screenshots of your latest UI webpages embedded directly within the file.

written explanation of how your UI's screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone4.md.

### How data is displayed
milestone5.md contains screenshots of how your data is displayed or visualized within your app. 
Include these as separate screenshots in addition to the general UI screenshots in rubric item 2. 
(You don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)

### Data display or visualizations

For the tips, we imported the data into our firebase and pulled the relevant data from there to display on the sceen for the user. To help with the parsing the data from the database, we use functions from the Underscorejs library. We also used the musixmatch API to get access to the popular children songs and their lyrics. Using the data from their API, we adjusted it to fit into the templates to display on the screen for the user. For stories, we scraped the web for children stories and imported that data into our firebase. Like the tips, we pulled the data from the database and parsed it so that we could display it on the screen as well.

Most all data interactions are done either with the musixmatch API or with firebase.

### Ambitious data display or visualization ideas


milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've 
implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel 
free to be more creative here. (2 points)

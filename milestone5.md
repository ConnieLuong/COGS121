### User story
a paragraph describing how someone in your target user population would use your app in order to help them achieve 
relevant goals. Think of this as a storyboard (setting+sequence+satisfaction) except written in a paragraph instead 
of using drawings. (2 points)

### UI screenshots
screenshots of your latest UI webpages embedded directly within the file.

written explanation of how your UI's screenshots have improved upon the versions shown in milestone4.md.

### How data is displayed
milestone5.md contains screenshots of how your data is displayed or visualized within your app. 
Include these as separate screenshots in addition to the general UI screenshots in rubric item 2. 
(You don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)

### Data display or visualizations
milestone5.md contains a written explanation of how you implemented your data display or visualizations, 
such as which libraries/frameworks you used (if any), how you hooked up to data APIs or databases, etc. 
(Again, you don't need a fancy visualization, but your data needs to be shown in a way that makes sense for your app.)

### Ambitious data display or visualization ideas
milestone5.md contains a paragraph describing some more ambitious data display or visualization ideas beyond what you've 
implemented that would make your app more polished. Note that you do NOT need to implement those ideas, so feel 
free to be more creative here. (2 points)

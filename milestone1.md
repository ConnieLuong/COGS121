### Pitch:
(3) aspects of app
1. Self- Improvement
2. Relationship with partner
3. Relationship with baby 

Our app’s target population are dads-to-be and first time fathers who may be struggling to what to do to support their wives as well as with getting involved in the process of raising babies when they first become fathers. Also, since there are existing gender norms that restrict women to the domestic space and men to the public space, wives are assigned most of the children nurturing tasks because of their “natural” motherhood. Therefore husbands are often not actively involved in the process of having and taking care of babies. So our app aims to help families balance the commitment from both parents into the child care process and to provide new fathers with the appropriate resources to confidently kick out their first parenting experience!
The proposed app has two main sections, one on what to do to support their wives and the other on what to do to care for their babies.
** the hardest part of pregnancy is the year during pregnancy + first year after birth (2 years total), this is our target. 

The project theme is to “design for people very different from ourselves.” Our target population, as mentioned, are first time fathers. As none of our members have any personal experience in this field, we will definitely need to do research in terms of needfinding and product design and development.

The home screen (feed page)
It contains the tips which will be presented in the form of news feed. User can navigate to other pages via the menu button at the top left corner.

The Songs & Stories page which the carousel will feature the hottest stories and songs. And there are three sections which will suggest the stories and songs for the users.


### The redesigned UI





For the redesigned UI, we chose yellow and orange as our main colors because we want to give the moods of warm and caring to our target users. We also added the tap features in both tips feed page and bedtime (song/story) page for users to navigate betweeen different categories of the content. When comparing the new and old feed page, we now hiding the share and favorite button. When the user clicks on the cards, the buttons and content will show within the same page by loading from the firebase instead of going to a new page.``` **(need to add description of new UI of bedtime.html)**```

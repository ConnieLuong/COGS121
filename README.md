### Notes
* Remember to run
`npm install`

* To run app, run
`npm start`

* Also remember to have the `secret.js` file at the top level. Don't explicitly commit `secret.js` file to github. You shouldn't have to worry about this, though, since it's included in `.gitignore`. Unless you explicitly commit & push it, `secret.js` will be ignored.

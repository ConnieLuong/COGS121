## Idea update: 
In milestone 1, we mentioned the idea of having some sort of app targeting first time fathers. We have decided to charge on with this idea. However, we did realize that the original idea was a bit lacking in terms of functionality. Originally, we proposed to have more of an information based app. But this alone didn't make the app very useful or interactive at all. So we decided to add a 'Songs & Stories' functionality. This would provide users access to a library of songs and stories they can share with their child. These songs and stories can also be saved into the user's Favorites for easy access. 

## Screenshots of UI skeleton webpages
* milestone2.md contains screenshots of all your UI skeleton webpages embedded directly within the file (not linked as external image files).

### Comparison to paper protoypes
* milestone2.md contains a written explanation of how your screenshots are similar to or differ from your paper prototypes in milestone1.md; it's perfectly okay if they are different (e.g., if you needed to change your initial idea), as long as you justify the changes.
